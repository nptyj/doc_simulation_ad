	2. install pip and MkDocs
	```sh
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install mkdocs
	```
	3. MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the mkdocs serve command:

	```sh
	mkdocs serve
	```
	
	Open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, and you'll see the default home page being displayed.
	The dev-server also supports auto-reloading, and will rebuild your documentation whenever anything in the configuration file, documentation directory, or theme directory changes. Edit the docs/index.md document and save your changes. Your browser will auto-reload and you should see your updated documentation immediately.
